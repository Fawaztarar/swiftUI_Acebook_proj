# Acebook Mobile Application

## Project Overview

The Acebook mobile application, crafted with inspiration from Facebook's mobile app, is an ongoing project developed in SwiftUI. Our goal is to build a comprehensive social networking platform. Currently, it supports core features such as user authentication, content creation, and social interaction.

### Current Features - incomplegte 

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and login capabilities with security measures to protect user information.
- **Content Creation**: Users can create, share, and manage their own posts within the Acebook community.
- **Social Interaction**: Users can like and comment on posts, fostering a community-driven environment.
- **Profile Customization**: The app allows users to edit their profile information, providing a personalized experience.

### Upcoming Features

- Additional media types for posts.
- Advanced user settings and privacy controls.
- Real-time notifications for social interactions.
- Search functionality and user friending capabilities.

## Development Status

The project's current phase has laid down the groundwork for Acebook's main features. However, given the project's ambitious scope, a week's development time has highlighted the need for further research and development, particularly in integrating a wider range of features that users expect from a modern social media application.

## Backend Integration

The mobile application is designed to integrate with an Acebook backend implemented in Node.js, providing a robust and scalable server-side platform.

## Continuing Development

The next steps for the Acebook project include:

1. Extensive research into additional features and user needs.
2. Iterative development cycles to implement, test, and refine new features.
3. Continuous integration and deployment to streamline development.
